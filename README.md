# stream-adventure Course Answers

## This repo contains the answers for the stream-adventure course. Each program is named as each task. See below for the instructions:

#### BEEP BOOP

Just to make sure everything is working, just write a `program.js` that outputs the string "beep boop" with a `console.log()`.

#### MEET PIPE

You will get a file as the first argument to your program (process.argv[2]). Use `fs.createReadStream()` to pipe the given file to `process.stdout`.

`fs.createReadStream()` takes a file as an argument and returns a readable stream that you can call `.pipe()` on. Here's a readable stream that pipes its data to `process.stderr`:

    var fs = require('fs');
    fs.createReadStream('data.txt').pipe(process.stderr);

Your program is basically the same idea, but instead of `'data.txt'`, the filename comes from `process.argv[2]` and you should pipe to stdout, not stderr.

#### INPUT OUTPUT

Take data from `process.stdin` and pipe it to `process.stdout`. With `.pipe()`. `process.stdin.pipe()` to be exact.

#### TRANSFORM

Convert data from `process.stdin` to upper-case data on `process.stdout` using the `through2` module.

To get the `through2` module you'll need to do:

    npm install through2

A transform stream takes input data and applies an operation to the data to
produce the output data.

Create a through stream with a `write` and `end` function:

    var through = require('through2');
    var stream = through(write, end);

The `write` function is called for every buffer of available input:

    function write (buffer, encoding, next) {
        // ...
    }

and the `end` function is called when there is no more data:

    function end () {
        // ...
    }

Inside the write function, call `this.push()` to produce output data and call
`next()` when you're ready to receive the next chunk:

    function write (buffer, encoding, next) {
        this.push('I got some data: ' + buffer + '\n');
        next();
    }

and call `done()` to finish the output:

    function end (done) {
        done();
    }

`write` and `end` are both optional. If `write` is not specified, the default implementation passes the input data to the output unmodified. If `end` is not specified, the default implementation calls `this.push(null)` to close the output side when the input side ends.

Make sure to pipe `process.stdin` into your transform stream and pipe your transform stream into `process.stdout`, like this:

    process.stdin.pipe(tr).pipe(process.stdout);

To convert a buffer to a string, call `buffer.toString()`.

#### LINES

Instead of transforming every line as in the previous "TRANSFORM" example, for this challenge, convert even-numbered lines to upper-case and odd-numbered
lines to lower-case. Consider the first line to be odd-numbered. For example given this input:

    One
    Two
    Three
    Four

Your program should output:

    one
    TWO
    three
    FOUR

You can use the `split` module to split input by newlines. For example:

    var split = require('split');
    process.stdin
        .pipe(split())
        .pipe(through2(function (line, _, next) {
            console.dir(line.toString());
            next();
        }))
    ;

`split` will buffer chunks on newlines before you get them. In the previous example, we will get separate events for each line even though all the data
probably arrives on the same chunk:

    $ echo -e 'one\ntwo\nthree' | node split.js
    'one'
    'two'
    'three'

Your own program should use `split` in this way, but you should transform the input and pipe the output through to `process.stdout`.

Make sure to `npm install split through2` in the directory where your solution file lives.

#### CONCAT

You will be given text on process.stdin. Buffer the text and reverse it using the `concat-stream` module before writing it to stdout.

`concat-stream` is a write stream that you can pass a callback to get the complete contents of a stream as a single buffer. Here's an example that uses concat to buffer POST content in order to JSON.parse() the submitted data:

    var concat = require('concat-stream');
    var http = require('http');
    
    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        if (req.method === 'POST') {
            req.pipe(concat(function (body) {
                var obj = JSON.parse(body);
                res.end(Object.keys(obj).join('\n'));
            }));
        }
        else res.end();
    });
    server.listen(5000);

In your adventure you'll only need to buffer input with `concat()` from process.stdin.

Make sure to `npm install concat-stream` in the directory where your solution file is located.
